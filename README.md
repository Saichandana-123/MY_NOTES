# My_Notes
Welcome to my handwritten notes collection! 📚✍️

I’m that girl who loves learning, organizing, and sharing all the knowledge I’ve gathered from various sources. These notes cover everything I’ve studied—from Electrical Engineering subjects(Like Electronic,control systems) to DSA algorithms, ML techniques, and much more. I’m making them public for anyone looking to level up their study game! 🚀

Feel free to explore, use, and share—because knowledge is meant to be shared! 💡✨ If you have feedback or cool ideas, drop me a message, and let’s make this even better! 💌

Happy studying, and let’s grow together! 🌱📖


Note: NOT all but Some/some parts of these notes are in Teluglish (a mix of Telugu and English), so if you're not familiar with Telugu, no worries—just roll with it! 😉
